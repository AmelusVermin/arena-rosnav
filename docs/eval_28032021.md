# Evaluation Run 28.03.2021 Instructions
## Run DRL1,2,3 agents:
1. Parameter: select subgoal mode in the *plan_fsm_param.yaml* file located at
```
src/arena-rosnav/arena_bringup/launch/plan_fsm_param.yaml
```
* subgoal_mode:
- Change to 
  - 0:  spatial-horizon-wp, 
  - 1:  time-space-wp, 
  - 2:  subsampling-wp
  

2. [Terminal 1] Start the *simulation environment* with the specific scenario e.g. map1, 20 obstacles:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch map_file:="map1"  disable_scenario:="false" scenario_file:="eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json"
```
* roslaunch parameters:
  * map_file:
    * map1
    * map_empty
  * disable_scenario: false
  * scenario_file:
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs5.json
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs10.json
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json
    * eval/obstacle_map_obs5.json
    * eval/obstacle_map_obs10.json
    * eval/obstacle_map_obs20.json

3. [Terminal 2] Start the *time-space plan manager*:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup timed_space_planner_fsm.launch
```

4. [Terminal 3] Afterwards, start the *action publisher*:
```
roscd arena_local_planner_drl/scripts/deployment/
```
```
python action_publisher.py
```
5. [Terminal 4] Start rosbag recording and name it with following convention: planner_wp-gen_map_obstacles_velocity
```
rosbag record -o drl1_map1_obs20_vel_01 /scenario_reset -e "(.*)police(.*)"
```
6. [Terminal 5] Run the ```run_agent.py``` script.

```
roscd arena_local_planner_drl/scripts/deployment/
```

```
python run_agent.py --load DRL_LOCAL_PLANNER_2021_03_22__19_33 --scenario obstacle_map1_obs20
```

1. Once the test runs finished (after 15 runs), 
- stop the rosbag record (rosbag will be saved in the directory where you executed the command)
- stop the run_agent.py script 
- stop the simulation environment
- stop action publisher and timespace manager as well
- change the parameters inside the plan_manager.yaml if neccessary (subgoal mode)
- change the parameters inside the scenario.json if neccessary (obstacle velocity)
- start again from step 1 with new scenarios/parameters

## local planner selection
1. teb, mpc, dwa, cadrl, rl_collision_avoidance, crowdnav

The local planner can be slected calling the roslaunch command listed below (ie "teb"):

```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch local_planner:="teb" 
```

For arena local planner, an additional Terminal is needed (first terminal can be set to teb):
```
roscd arena_ros/scripts/
python arena_node_tb3.py
```


2. dependencies:
DRL based local planners need some dependencies to be installed in order to run correctly.  
These can be found in the directory: arena-rosnav/arena_navigation/arena_local_planner/env
- cadrl:
  - pip install tensorflow==1.4.1
  - pip install numpy
  - build ford msg package in your catkin ws: https://bitbucket.org/acl-swarm/ford_msgs/src/master/
- rlca:
  - pip install mpi4py



## Parameter.yaml for plan manager(fsm:Finite state machine) 
The paramater yaml file is located at:
```
src/arena-rosnav/arena_bringup/launch/plan_fsm_param.yaml
```

the only parameter that are relavant to DRL:
* use_drl 
  *  true:  cmd_vel is published by drl 
  *  false: cmd_vel is published by ego local planner (which is a traj tracker)
* subgoal_mode:
  * 0:  spacial_horizon
  * 1:  timed_space
  * 2:  simple_sample
```
remark: keep "use_drl" true, in testing other planners other than ego local planner
```

## Run CADRL, MPC, ColRL, TEB Planner

## Run Ego Planner

In order to test ego local planner:

1. change the parameter "use_drl" to be false in *plan_fsm_param.yaml*
```
src/arena-rosnav/arena_bringup/launch/plan_fsm_param.yaml
```
* use_drl false


2. start *simulation environment*

You can choose with or wihout scenarios loaded
* without senarios:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch map_file:="map1"
```
* with senarios:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch map_file:="map1"  disable_scenario:="false" scenario_file:="eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json"
```

3. start the *time-space plan manager*:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup timed_space_planner_fsm.launch
```
4. in rviz set a goal position using *FlatlandNav Goal*
